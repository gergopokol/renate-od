REANTE Open Diagnostics (RENATE-OD)

Responsible developer: Dr. Gergo Pokol, www.reak.bme.hu/pokol

REANTE Open Diagnostics, or in short RENATE-OD is a physics based modelling suit for the beam 
emission spectroscopy diagnostic of magnetically confined high temperature plasmas.

RENATE-OD is being developed in Python strictly following the policies detailed in the 
programming_giudelines.pdf.

RENATE-OD is being developed under GPL. However, to avoid misuse we ask you to contact the 
responsible developer prior to real any use for science. We are just as open for collaboration, 
as our code is open form development!
